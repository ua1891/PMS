# TrackFlow Automated Notification System

Welcome to the TrackFlow application! This repository contains both the frontend (React + Vite) and the backend (Node.js + Express + Prisma) architectures.

## Prerequisites
To run this application, you must first install Node.js (https://nodejs.org/) on your machine.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Backend Setup
1. Open a terminal and navigate to the `backend` folder:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Initialize the Prisma database (SQLite):
   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate dev --name init
   ```
4. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   *The server will start on `http://localhost:5000` and the Cron job scheduler will immediately begin polling the TCS API every 5 minutes.*

### 2. Frontend Setup
1. Open a new terminal and navigate to the `frontend` folder:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the Vite development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Open the provided `localhost` URL (usually `http://localhost:5173`) in your browser to view the TrackFlow Dashboard.
